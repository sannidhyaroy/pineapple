# Build notes
Before building, you must do the following steps so that OAuth and basic network functionality will work:
1. Sign-in, and create a new app on https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps.
2. Choose `installed app` as type and set the redirect URI to `pineapple://login`, then proceed. It will generate a client secret.
3. Build in Android Studio or using gradle on the command line and install it.
3. Paste the client secret in the app's setup screen.
